            <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
              <li>
                Applied Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to develop a Warehouse
                Management System (WMS) tailored for a Just-in-Sequence (JIS)
                warehouse. This system supported immediate delivery of parts to
                the production line and managed the return of defective
                components.
              </li>
              <li>
                Implemented real-time tracking for each part during delivery and
                return, ensuring accuracy and traceability throughout the
                workflow.
              </li>
              <li>
                Developed monitoring functionality to validate the return
                process. Detected and resolved mismatches between items reported
                by material runners and items actually received by the
                warehouse, improving reliability of return operations.
              </li>
              <li>
                Designed and built a feature allowing JIS warehouse users to
                generate parts request lists. Integrated inventory control into
                the WMS to streamline replenishment from the main warehouse.
              </li>
              <li>
                Adopted Trunk-Based Development practices to streamline collaboration, reduce integration conflicts, and support continuous delivery of the WMS.
              </li>
              <li>
                Established a high-availability cluster to improve service
                reliability and minimize downtime in production.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>PEGATRON | 2022-2024</strong></p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
              <li>
                Designed and implemented a comprehensive Pick, Pack, and Ship
                system. This involved early-stage system design, front-end and
                back-end development, and integration with various hardware
                devices to ensure seamless operations.
              </li>
              <li>
                Gradually introduced unit tests to a legacy spring framework
                that previously lacked test coverage. Successfully added over
                1,000 unit tests, significantly improving code reliability and
                maintainability.
              </li>
              <li>
                Improved the front-end development workflow by streamlining
                processes and successfully upgrading the system from Vue 2 to
                Vue 3, enhancing performance and maintainability.
              </li>
              <li>
                Advocated for a strong design phase with clear documentation and
                user communication to ensure solutions meet needs and deliver
                value. Practiced these principles in my work to lead by example.

              <li>
                Contributed to the development of a scheduling system that
                automated a manual two-week process, reducing it to just a few
                minutes. Integrated existing client systems and delivered an
                intuitive interface for visualizing results. Adopted Test-Driven
                Development (TDD) with Phoenix framework for the back-end.
              </li>
              <li>
                Contributed to the development and maintenance of a mobile eBook
                application, focusing on back-end functionality using Elixir.

              <li>
                Participated in the development of an attendance management
                system from design to implementation. Built the back-end with
                Elixir and the front-end with React, integrating beacon
                technology as a time-tracking tool.
