              <li>
                Designed and implemented a comprehensive Pick, Pack, and Ship
                system. This involved early-stage system design, front-end and
                back-end development, and integration with various hardware
                devices to ensure seamless operations.
              </li>
              <li>
                Gradually introduced unit tests to a legacy spring framework
                that previously lacked test coverage. Successfully added over
                1,000 unit tests, significantly improving code reliability and
                maintainability.
              </li>
              <li>
                Improved the front-end development workflow by streamlining
                processes and successfully upgrading the system from Vue 2 to
                Vue 3, enhancing performance and maintainability.
              </li>
              <li>
                Advocated for a strong design phase with clear documentation and
                user communication to ensure solutions meet needs and deliver
                value. Practiced these principles in my work to lead by example.

                Contributed to the development of a scheduling system that
                automated a manual two-week process, reducing it to just a few
                minutes. Integrated existing client systems and delivered an
                intuitive interface for visualizing results. Adopted Test-Driven
                Development (TDD) with Phoenix framework for the back-end.
              </li>
              <li>
                Contributed to the development and maintenance of a mobile eBook
                application, focusing on back-end functionality using Elixir.
              </li>
              <li>
                Participated in the development of an attendance management
                system from design to implementation. Built the back-end with
                Elixir and the front-end with React, integrating beacon
                technology as a time-tracking tool.
