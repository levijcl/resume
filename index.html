              Designed and implemented a comprehensive Pick, Pack, and Ship
              system. This involved early-stage system design, front-end and
              back-end development, and integration with various hardware
              devices to ensure seamless operations.
            </li>
            <li>
              Gradually introduced unit tests to a legacy spring framework that
              previously lacked test coverage. Successfully added over 1,000
              unit tests, significantly improving code reliability and
              maintainability.
            </li>
            <li>
              Improved the front-end development workflow by streamlining
              processes and successfully upgrading the system from Vue 2 to Vue
              3, enhancing performance and maintainability.
            </li>
            <li>
              Advocated for a strong design phase with clear documentation and
              user communication to ensure solutions meet needs and deliver
              value. Practiced these principles in my work to lead by example.

                Contributed to the development of a scheduling system that
                automated a manual two-week process, reducing it to just a few
                minutes. Integrated existing client systems and delivered an
                intuitive interface for visualizing results. Adopted Test-Driven
                Development (TDD) with Phoenix framework for the back-end.

                Participated in the development of an attendance management
                system from design to implementation. Built the back-end with
                Elixir and the front-end with React, integrating beacon
                technology as a time-tracking tool.
